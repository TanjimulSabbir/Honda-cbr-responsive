            <img class="m-auto border d-block" src="images/News/news-1.1.jpg" alt=""> <span id="FullHistory">Since its
                2004 introduction, the CRF250R has amassed nine
                Regional
                AMA 250SX Supercross
                titles (including the 2019 and ’20 East Region crowns), plus two AMA 250MX
                Championships.
                Phoenix Racing has also won the last three AMA Arenacross titles with the CRF250R, with
                Kyle
                Peters going undefeated during the 2021 season. With seven of 12 rounds completed, Jett
                and
                Hunter Lawrence have both earned 250MX overall wins in the AMA Pro Motocross series, and
                they sit second and third in the title chase, respectively. Each of the CRF250R’s updates is transferred
                to the 2022
                CRF250RX, whose closed-course, off-road realm is the ideal application for the increased low-end power.
                The CRF250RX also has model-specific features to provide appropriate suspension performance, power
                delivery, fuel range, hand protection and convenience, making it an appropriate machine for SLR Honda
                rider Tallon LaFountaine (the reigning AMA NGPC Pro 250 Champion), JCR Honda’s Tarah Gieger and Phoenix
                Racing Honda GNCC riders Ruy Barbosa and Cody Barnes.

                While the focus is on the all-new 2022 CRF250R and CRF250RX, Honda also announced the returning CRF150R
                and CRF150R Big Wheel, as well as the hugely popular full CRF Trail lineup—the CRF250F, CRF125F and
                CRF125F Big Wheel, CRF110F and CRF50F—all of which are year-round off-road legal in all 50 states.
                Nonetheless, Honda engineers weren’t interested in letting the model rest on its laurels
                for
                2022, as they introduced a host of updates that raise the bar for usable power,
                impeccable
                handling and robust durability, by boosting engine performance, increasing toughness and
                cutting weight. The redesigned engine produces more low-rpm torque without sacrificing
                usable top-end power, resulting in a broader powerband. <img class="m-auto border d-block"
                    src="images/News/news-1.2.jpeg" alt="">Chassis updates
                delivered significant weight savings and improved ergonomics while preserving the
                model’s
                renowned handling prowess. A redesigned exhaust system and additional lightened
                components
                resulted in a substantial reduction of 8 pounds, for a 229-pound vehicle curb weight. In
                addition, durability was improved by thoroughly reexamining the engine, its cooling
                system
                and the drive components, while notable improvements were also made to the clutch. “The
                CRF250R has always been all about racing, and its success record proves that, with top
                results at the factory level by Jett and Hunter Lawrence, and also in the amateur
                ranks,”
                said Brandon Wilson, Sports & Experiential Manager at American Honda. “With reduced
                weight,
                increased power where it matters most and improved durability, the all-new 2022 CRF250R
                is
                more competitive than ever, and we can’t wait to see what the Lawrence brothers and all
                Red
                Riders do with it on motocross tracks across the U.S.”</span>
            CRF250RX
            For 2022, this bona fide closed-course off-road weapon is all-new, with the same upgrades as the
            motocross-focused CRF250R. Those changes, which result in reduced weight, more low-end power and improved
            durability, are particularly well-suited to closed-course off-road series such as NGPC, GNCC and WORCS—the
            realms of top teams like SLR Honda, JCR Honda and Phoenix Racing Honda. Making the bike even better suited
            for those applications, the CRF250RX comes standard with model-specific features such as a resin 2.1-gallon
            fuel tank, dedicated suspension and ECU settings, an 18-inch rear wheel and plastic hand guards.

            CRF150R
            The powersports industry’s most popular mini motocrosser, the CRF150R is offered in both standard and Big
            Wheel versions, the latter featuring larger wheels, a higher seat and additional rear-suspension travel,
            making it a great choice for taller riders. Honda’s smallest motocross model boasts Showa® suspension,
            including a 37 mm inverted fork and a single shock mated to a Pro-Link® rear linkage system, plus a Unicam®
            four-stroke engine that is unique in the mini MX world, delivering a strong but smooth spread of power
            across the rev range.

            CRF250F
            Few motorcycles can lay claim to being as versatile as the fun but capable CRF250F—a great choice for
            appropriately sized riders getting their feet wet off-road, but also very well suited for tackling
            challenging terrain at the hands of more experienced riders. Featuring Keihin electronically controlled fuel
            injection, the clean-running, low-maintenance CRF250F is year-round off-road legal in all 50 states. The
            long-stroke, air-cooled SOHC engine puts out strong-but-manageable acceleration, while the
            confidence-inspiring Showa suspension delivers a compliant ride in varied terrain. Add it up, and it’s no
            wonder that the flagship of Honda’s CRF Trail line is the industry’s top-selling full-size dirt bike; after
            all, it’s like owning multiple dirt bikes for the price of one!

            <h2 class="text-center">Limited Edition 2022 Ducati Panigale V2 Bayliss 1st Championship 20th
                Anniversary</h2>
            <img class="d-block m-auto mt-3"
                src="https://blog.motorcycle.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/072321-2021-ducati-Panigale-V2-Bayliss-f-633x389.png"
                alt="">
            To make the motorcycle even more effective in track riding, Ducati has chosen to equip the Panigale
            V2
            Bayliss 1st Championship 20th Anniversary with Öhlins components. The NX30 front fork and TTX36 rear
            shock
            absorber guarantee maximum smoothness and are designed to achieve the best performance on the
            circuit, with
            a set-up that makes the bike more precise and offers the rider greater feeling and greater support
            in all
            riding phases. The steering damper, thanks to the adjustments it is equipped with, allows you to
            customize
            its calibration by adapting it to riding style and the characteristics of the track.

            Compared to the standard version, the Panigale V2 Bayliss 1st Championship 20th Anniversary is also
            3 kg
            lighter, thanks to the adoption of a lithium-ion battery and the choice of the single-seater
            configuration
            that explicitly recalls the look of the racing bike (passenger seat and footrests are available in
            the
            equipment supplied).

            The equipment is completed by the sport grips, the silencer outlet cover in carbon fibre and
            titanium and
            the rider seat made by combining two different technical materials with double red stitching. Troy’s
            number
            21 is embroidered in white on the saddle and, together with the green and red bands, makes up the
            Italian
            flag. The motorcycle is also equipped with self-cleaning brake and clutch pumps with smoke grey oil
            tanks.



            The Panigale V2 is the super-mid of Ducati sports bikes and represents the entry model to the
            Panigale
            family. It is powered by the 955 cc Superquadro twin-cylinder unit (Euro 5 compliant), with a
            maximum power
            of 155 hp at 10,750 rpm and a maximum torque of 104 Nm at 9,000 rpm. The chassis is based on the
            monocoque
            frame, while the elegant and sporty design is inspired by that of the Panigale V4.

            The electronic package, dedicated to active safety and vehicle dynamics control, includes the
            “cornering”
            function applied to Bosch ABS, the electronic quick shift that also works when downshifting and
            traction,
            engine brake and wheelie controls (Ducati Quick Shift, Ducati Traction Control, Ducati Wheelie
            Control,
            Engine Brake Control). All the controls are integrated into the three Riding Modes (Race, Sport and
            Street)
            that can be modified using the 4.3″ colour TFT dashboard with graphics and interface designed to
            make menu
            navigation and settings adjustment intuitive, as well as immediate identification of the selected
            Riding
            Mode.

            The bike was officially presented by Ducati in a special episode of the Ducati World Première (here
            the link
            to see it) made at the Ducati Museum, on the track and at Troy’s home in Australia. Ducati CEO
            Claudio
            Domenicali, Ducati Corse Team Manager Davide Tardozzi, who was alongside Bayliss throughout his
            career in
            Ducati, Director of the Centro Stile Ducati Andrea Ferraresi and Ducati Head of Product
            Communications
            Giulio Fabbri all contributed to the presentation of the characteristics of the bike and the
            storytelling of
            the incredible relationship between Ducati and Bayliss. Troy himself took part in this video,
            sharing with
            Ducatisti his most indelible memories and emotions experienced on the bike.

            The World Superbike universe will also pay tribute to Bayliss’s career during Round 5 of the season,
            scheduled for the weekend at the Assen track. On Friday 23 July at 13.00 (CEST), the Australian
            champion
            will be the protagonist of a virtual press conference at the Paddock Show together with Ducati Corse
            Sporting Director Paolo Ciabatti, in which the most important stages of the victory of Troy’s first
            title,
            won on the Dutch circuit, will be remembered. On Sunday 25 July at 12.05 (CEST), after the SuperPole
            Race,
            the Panigale V2 Bayliss 1st Championship 20th Anniversary will complete a lap of honour on the
            track, ridden
            by Aruba.it Racing – Ducati Team rider Michael Ruben Rinaldi, who competes in WorldSBK with the same
            number
            as Bayliss.



            The twentieth anniversary of Troy Bayliss winning his first title with Ducati is being celebrated in
            Borgo
            Panigale with a temporary exhibition in the Museo Ducati entitled “Troy Story: The Legend of a
            Champion”
            which exhibits the bikes with which Troy was able to write some memorable chapters in the history of
            motorcycle racing. The exhibition can be visited until 19 September 2021 (here more information on
            visits to
            the Museo Ducati).

            The Panigale V2 Bayliss 1st Championship 20th Anniversary will be available in all dealers in the
            Ducati
            network starting from the end of September 2021 at a dealer price of €20,990 (referred to the
            Italian
            market).
